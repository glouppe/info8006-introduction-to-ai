\begin{thbox}{Kolmogorov's axioms}
    A probability space is a sample space equipped with a probability function, i.e.
an assignment $P : \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $P(\omega) \in \mathbb{R}, 0 \leq P(\omega)$ for all $\omega \in \Omega$.
    \item $P(\Omega) = 1$.
    \item $P(\{\omega_1, ..., \omega_n\}) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(\omega_i)$.
\end{enumerate}
with $\Omega$ a \thighlight{sample space}, $\omega \in \Omega$ a \thighlight{sample point} and $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ the power set of $\Omega$.
\end{thbox}

\begin{thbox}{Probability rules}
    The \thighlight{product rule} states that
    $$
    P(a,b) = P(b)P(a\mid b) = P(a)P(b\mid a)
    $$ 
    from which \thighlight{Baye's formula} is derived as
    $$
    P(a\mid b) = \dfrac{P(b\mid a)P(a)}{P(b)}
    $$
    with $P(a,b)$ being the joint probability of events $a$ and $b$, $P(b)$ - $P(a)$ the marginals and $P(a\mid b)$ - $P(b\mid a)$ the conditionals.\\

    The \thighlight{chain rule} states that 
    $$
    P(x_1,..,x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i\mid x_1, ..., x_{i-1}). 
    $$

\section{Beliefs}

Let $A$ and $B$ be two \emph{events} over the probability space $\Omega$. An agent holds the beliefs $P(A) = 0.4$ and $P(B) = 0.3$. What ranges of probabilities would it be rational for the agent to hold for the events $A \cup B$ and $A \cap B$ ? What if the agent also believes that $P(A | B) = 0.5$ ?

\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The agent's beliefs should satisfy
        \begin{alignat*}{2}
            0.4 = \max \cbk{P(A), P(B)} & \leq P(A \cup B) && \leq \min \cbk{1, P(A) + P(B)} = 0.7 \\
            0 = \max \cbk{0, P(A) + P(B) - 1} & \leq P(A \cap B) && \leq \min \cbk{P(A), P(B)} = 0.3 .
        \end{alignat*}
        This can be illustrated with Venn diagrams.

        \item If the agent believes that $P(A | B) = 0.5$, it should also believe that
        \begin{equation*}
            P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) P(B) = 0.5 \times 0.3 = 0.15,
        \end{equation*}
        thanks to Bayes rule. Then, the agent should rationally believe that
        \begin{equation*}
            P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55.
        \end{equation*}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

Given the hereabove probability table, compute the following probabilities:

\begin{solution}
    In the following, we represent the events $toothache$, $catch$ and $cavity$ by the random variables $T, CT, CV: \Omega \mapsto \cbk{0, 1}$, respectively. Then, the hereabove table represents the joint probability distribution $P(T, CT, CV)$. When clear from context, we abbreviate the probability of a realization $(t, ct, cv)$ by $P(t, ct, cv)$ instead of $P(T = t, CT = ct, CV = cv)$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $P(toothache)$

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{equation*}
            P(CV = 1) = \sum_{t} \sum_{ct} P(t, ct, CV = 1) = 0.108 + 0.012 + 0.072 + 0.008 = 0.2

    \item $P(toothache | cavity)$

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{align*}
            P(T = 1 | CV = 1) = \frac{P(T = 1, CV = 1)}{P(CV = 1)} & = \frac{\sum_{ct} P(T = 1, ct, CV = 1)}{P(CV = 1)} \\
            & = \frac{0.108 + 0.012}{0.2} = 0.6

\section{(AIMA, Ex 13.15)}

After your yearly checkup, the doctor has bad news and good news. The bad news is that you tested positive for a serious disease and that the test is \qty{99}{\percent} accurate, \ie{} the probability of testing positive when you do have the disease is \num{0.99} and the probability of testing positive when you don't is \num{0.01}. The good news is that this is a rare disease, striking only 1 in \num{10000} people of your age. Why is it good news that the disease is rare? What are the chances that you actually have the disease?

\begin{solution}
    It is a good news because the conditional probability will drop due to the weak prior value. Indeed,
    \begin{align*}
        P(d | t) & = \frac{P(t | d) P(d)}{P(t)} \\
        & = \frac{P(t | d) P(d)}{P(t | d) P(d) + P(t | \neg d) P(\neg d)} \\
        & = \frac{0.99 \times \num{e-4}}{0.99 \times \num{e-4} + 0.01 \times (1 - \num{e-4})} = \num{0.0098} .

For each of the following statements, either prove it is valid or give a counterexample.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $P(a | b, c) = P(b | a, c)$, then $P(a | c) = P(b | c)$.

    \begin{solution}
        True. By the conditional probability rule we have $P(a | b, c) P(b, c) = P(b | a, c) P(a, c)$, which by assumption reduces to $P(b, c) = P(a, c)$ and thereby $P(b | c) = P(a | c)$.
    \end{solution}

    \item If $P(a | b, c) = P(a)$, then $P(b | c) = P(b)$.

    \begin{solution}
        False. The statement $P(a | b, c) = P(a)$ merely states that $a$ is independent of $b$ and $c$, it makes no claim regarding the dependence of $b$ and $c$. Counterexample: $a$ and $b$ record the results of two independent coin flips, and $c = b$.
    \end{solution}

    \item If $P(a | b) = P(a)$, then $P(a | b, c) = P(a | c)$.

    \begin{solution}
        False. While the statement $P(a | b) = P(a)$ implies that $a$ is independent of $b$, it does not imply that $a$ is conditionally independent of $b$ given $c$. Counterexample: $a$ and $b$ record the results of two independent coin flips, and $c = a \vee b$.
    \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bag of coins}

We have a bag of three biased coins $a$, $b$, and $c$ with probabilities of coming up heads of \qty{20}{\percent}, \qty{60}{\percent}, and \qty{80}{\percent}, respectively. One coin is drawn randomly from the bag (with equal probability of drawing each of the three coins), and then the coin is flipped three times to generate the outcomes $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$ (heads or tail).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the Bayesian network corresponding to this setup and define the corresponding conditional probability tables (CPTs).

    \begin{solution}
        The process is described with the following random variables:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Y \in \cbk{a, b, c}$, the coin drawn from the bag.
            \item $X_i \in \cbk{h, t}$, the realization of the $i$-th coin toss.
        \end{itemize}
        The variable $Y$ is the parent of $X_i$, it should be put before in the network ordering.

                     $Y$ & $P(Y)$ & $P(X_i = h | Y)$ \\
                     \midrule
                     $a$ & $\frac{1}{3}$ & $0.2$ \\
                     $b$ & $\frac{1}{3}$ & $0.6$ \\
                     $c$ & $\frac{1}{3}$ & $0.8$ \\
                    \bottomrule
                \end{tabular}
            \end{subfigure}
        \end{figure}
    \end{solution}

    \item Determine which coin ($a$, $b$ or $c$) is most likely to have been drawn from the bag if the observed tosses came out heads twice and tail once.

    \begin{solution}
        In order to find the most likely coin, we have to calculate the conditional probability distribution $P(Y | X_1 = h, X_2 = h, X_3 = t)$\footnote{It should be noted that the order of the tosses is irrelevant as they are performed independently.}. Thanks to Bayes rule, we have
        \begin{equation*}
        P(Y | X_1 = h, X_2 = h, X_3 = t) = \alpha P(X_1 = h, X_2 = h, X_3 = t | Y) P(Y).
        \end{equation*}
        But we know that $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$ are independent with respect to $Y$, meaning that
        \begin{equation*}
            P(X_1, X_2, X_3 | Y) = P(X_1 | Y) P(X_2 | Y) P(X_3 | Y).
        \end{equation*}
        Then, we have
        \begin{equation*}
            P(Y | X_1 = h, X_2 = h, X_3 = t) = \alpha \times \frac{1}{3} \times \begin{cases}
                0.2 \times 0.2 \times 0.8 = \num{0.032} & \text{if } Y = a \\
                0.6 \times 0.6 \times 0.4 = \num{0.144} & \text{if } Y = b \\
                0.8 \times 0.8 \times 0.2 = \num{0.128} & \text{if } Y = c \\
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation*}
        meaning that $b$ is the most likely coin to have been drawn. Interestingly, we don't need to normalize the distribution as we only care about the maximum.
    \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Handedness (AIMA, Ex 14.6)}

Let $H_x$ be a random variable denoting the handedness of an individual $x$, with possible values $l$ or $r$. A common \emph{hypothesis} is that left or right-handedness is inherited by a simple mechanism; that is, there is a gene $G_x$, also with values $l$ or $r$, and $H_x$ turns out the same as $G_x$ with some probability $s$.

Furthermore, the gene itself is equally likely to be inherited from either of the individual's parents, with a small nonzero probability $m$ of a random mutation flipping the gene.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following networks claim that $P(G_{child} | G_{mother}, G_{father}) = P(G_{child})$ ?

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/e3_handedness.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{solution}
        The third one, as the node $G_{child}$ does not have any parents.
    \end{solution}

    \item Which of the networks make independence claims that are consistent with the hypothesis about the inheritance of handedness ?

    \begin{solution}
        The first and second ones. It should be noted that the second one is also valid as it makes \emph{less} assumptions about the variables dependencies, \ie{} it is more general than the first one.
    \end{solution}

    \item Write down the CPT for the $G_{child}$ nodes in first network, in terms of $s$ and $m$.

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{table}[h]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{cc|c}
                \toprule
                 $G_{mother}$ & $G_{father}$ & $P(G_{child} = l | G_{mother}, G_{father})$ \\
                 \midrule
                 $l$ & $l$ & $1 - m$ \\
                 $l$ & $r$ & $0.5$ \\
                 $r$ & $l$ & $0.5$ \\
                 $r$ & $r$ & $m$ \\
                \bottomrule
            \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
    \end{solution}

    \item Suppose that $P(G_{mother} = l) = P(G_{father} = l) = q$. In the first network, derive an expression for $P(G_{child} = l)$ in terms of $s$, $m$ and $q$.
    \begin{solution}
        \begin{align*}
            P(G_{child} = l) & = \sum_{g_m} \sum_{g_f} P(G_{child} = l, g_m, g_f) \\
            & = \sum_{g_m} \sum_{g_f} P(G_{child} = l | g_m, g_f) P(g_m) P(g_f) \\
            & = (1 - m) q^2 + 0.5 (1 - q) q + 0.5 q (1 - q) + m (1 - q)^2 \\
            & = q + m - 2qm
        \end{align*}
    \end{solution}

    \item Under conditions of genetic equilibrium, we expect the distribution of genes to be the same across generations. Use this to calculate the value of $q$, and, given what you know about handedness in humans, explain why the hypothesis described at the beginning of this question must be wrong.

    \begin{solution}
        Under genetic equilibrium, we have $P(G_{child} = l) = P(G_{parent} = l) = q$. Therefore, $q = q + m - 2 q m$ meaning that $q = 0.5$. In practice, being left-handed is much more rare than being right-handed which invalidates the initial hypothesis.
    \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
