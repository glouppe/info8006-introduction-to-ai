  \section*{Objectives}
  At the end of this exercise session you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
   \item define rigorously what is a "Search Problem".
   \item theoretically analyse the algorithms to perform uninformed (Depth-first, Breadth-first, Uniform-cost) and informed (Greedy-search, A-star) search.
   \item apply each of these algorithms on any search problem defined in a fully observable and deterministic environment.
\end{itemize}

   \subsection*{(2) Maze Car ($\approx$ 25 min)}
   %The project RAGI aims at building an agent,	
%meant	to	recognize	people	entering	a	building, welcome	them	and	guide	them	into Montefiore Institute,	
%in	a	smart	way. 
   %Imagine a car-like agent wishes to guide a visitor to Professor Louppe's office a maze like the one shown below:
This exercice is taken from \url{http://ai.berkeley.edu/sections/section_1_0hzy6TFupb1Z3bckfRXdC5KYpsdZOE.pdf}.\\
Imagine a car-like agent wishes to exit a maze like the one shown below:
\\
\includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/tp1_maze.png}\\
The agent is directional and at all times faces some direction d $\in$ (N, S, E, W). With a single action, the agent
can either move forward at an adjustable velocity v or turn. The turning actions are left and right, which change
the agent’s direction by 90 degrees. Turning is only permitted when the velocity is zero (and leaves it at zero).
The moving actions are fast and slow. Fast increments the velocity by 1 and slow decrements the velocity by 1;
in both cases the agent then moves a number of squares equal to its NEW adjusted velocity. Any action that
would result in a collision with a wall crashes the agent and is illegal. Any action that would reduce v below 0
or above a maximum speed $V_{max}$ is also illegal. The agent’s goal is to find a plan which parks it (stationary)
on the exit square using as few actions (time steps) as possible.
As an example: if the agent shown were initially stationary, it might first turn to the east using (right), then
move one square east using fast, then two more squares east using fast again. The agent will of course have to
slow to turn.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quizz ($\approx 15$ minutes):
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If the grid is M by N, what is the size of the state space? You should assume that all configurations are reachable from the start state. 
    \begin{solution}
    \\
    $N \times M \times 4 \times (V_{max} + 1)$
    \end{solution}
    \item What is the maximum branching factor of this problem? You may assume that illegal actions are simply not returned by the successor function.
    \begin{solution}
    \\
    The maximum branching factor is 3, and this happens when the agent is stationary. While stationary it
    can take the following 3 actions - fast, left, right.
    \end{solution}
    \item Is the Manhattan distance from the agent’s location to the exit’s location admissible?
    \begin{solution}
    \\
    No because it could overestimate the true cost in the case where the average car speed is greater than 1.
    \end{solution}
    \item If we used an inadmissible heuristic in A* tree search, could it change the completeness of the search?
    \begin{solution}\\
    No, A star will still find a final state if there exists a reachable one.
    \end{solution}
    \item If we used an inadmissible heuristic in A* tree search, could it change the optimality of the search?
    \begin{solution}\\
    Yes, we could stop the search whereas there exists a better solution.
    \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Discussion (if time permits) ($\approx 10$ minutes):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item State and justify a non-trivial admissible heuristic for this problem.
        \begin{solution}\\
        Some examples of admissible heuristics are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The Manhattan distance divided by the speed max.
            \item We can improve the above relaxation by accounting for the deceleration dynamics. In this case the
agent will have to slow down to 0 when it is about to reach the goal. Note that this heuristic will
always return a greater value than the previous one, but is still not an overestimate of the true cost
to reach the goal. We can say that this heuristic dominates the previous one
        \end{itemize}
        \end{solution}
        \item Give a general advantage that an inadmissible heuristic might have over an admissible one.
        \begin{solution}
        \\
        The time to solve an A* tree search problem is a function of two factors: the number of nodes expanded,
and the time spent per node.
An inadmissible heuristic may be faster to compute, leading to a solution that is obtained faster due to
less time spent per node. It can also be a closer estimate to the actual cost function (even though at times
it will overestimate!), thus expanding less nodes.
We lose the guarantee of optimality by using an inadmissible heuristic. But sometimes we may be okay
with finding a suboptimal solution to a search problem.
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\section*{Supplementary exercises}
\subsection*{(1) Heuristic}
Consider a search problem where all edges have cost 1 and the optimal solution has cost C. Let h be a heuristic which is max\{$h^* - k$, 0\}, where $h^*$ is the actual cost to the closest goal and k is a nonnegative constant.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is $h$ admissible?
    \begin{solution}
    \\
    Yes.
    \end{solution}
    \item Which of the following is the most reasonable description of how much more work will be done (= how many more nodes will be expanded) with heuristic h compared to $h^\star$ , as a function of k?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Constant in k
        \item Linear in k
        \item Exponential in k
        \item Unbounded
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{solution}
    %\\
    Exponential in k. At k = 0, only the d nodes on an optimal path to the closest goal are expanded for search depth (= optimal path length) d. At k = max(h), the problem reduces to uninformed search and BFS expands b d nodes for branching factor b. In general, all nodes within distance k of the closest goal will have heuristic h = 0 and uninformed search may expand them. Note that search reduces to BFS since A* with h = 0 is UCS and in this search problem all edges have cost 1 so path cost = path length
    \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{(3) The hive}
The hive of insects needs your help. You control an insect in a rectangular maze-like environment
with dimensions M x N, as shown on \ref{fig:hive}. At each time step,
the insect can move into a free adjacent square or stay in its current
location. All actions have cost 1. \\
In this particular case, the insect must pass through a series of partially
flooded tunnels. Flooded squares are lightly shaded in the example map
shown. The insect can hold its breath for A time steps in a row. Moving
into a flooded square requires your insect to expend 1 unit of air, while
moving into a free square refills its air supply.
