# Planning agents

# Reflex agents

Reflex agents
- select actions on the basis of the current percept;
- may have a model of the world current state;
- do not consider the future consequences of their actions;
- consider only **how the world is now**.

.Q[[Q]] Can a reflex agent be rational?

???

Yes, provided the correct decision can be made on the basis of the current percept. That is, if the environment is fully observable, deterministic and known.

In the figure, the sequence of actions is clearly suboptimal.

# Problem-solving agents

Assumptions:
- *Observable*, *deterministic* (and *known*) environment.

Problem-solving agents
- take decisions based on (hypothesized) consequences of actions;
- must have a model of how the world evolves in response to actions;
- formulate a goal, explicitly;
- consider **how to world would be**.

## Offline vs. Online solving

- Problem-solving agents are *offline*. The solution is executed "eyes closed", ignoring the percepts.
- *Online* problem solving involves acting without complete knowledge. In this case, the sequence of actions might be recomputed at each step.

# Search problems

# Search problems

A **search problem** consists of the following components:
- The *initial state* of the agent.
- A description of the *actions* available to the agent given a state $s$, denoted $\text{actions}(s)$.
- A *transition model* that returns the state $s' = \text{result}(s, a)$ that results from doing action $a$ in state $s$.
    - We say that $s'$ is a *successor* of $s$ if there is an acceptable action from $s$ to $s'$.

.center[![](figures/lec2/pacman-successor.png)]

---

class: middle

.center[![](figures/lec2/pacman-space.png)]

- Together, the initial state, the actions and the transition model define the **state space** of the problem, i.e. the set of all states reachable from the initial state by any sequence of action.
    - The state space forms a directed graph:
        - nodes = states
        - links = actions
    - A *path* is a sequence of states connected by actions.
- A *goal test* which determines whether the solution of the problem is achieved in state $s$.
- A *path cost* that assigns a numeric value to each path.
  - We may also assume that the path cost corresponds to a sum of positive *step costs* $c(s,a,s')$  associated to the action $a$ in $s$ leading to $s'$.

---

class: middle

A **solution** to a problem is an action sequence that leads from the initial state to a goal state.
- A solution quality is measured by the path cost function.
- An *optimal solution* has the lowest path cost
among all solutions.

<span class="Q">[Q]</span> What if the environment is partially observable? non-deterministic?

???

- With partial observability, the agent needs to keep in which states it might be in.
    - Percepts narrow down the set of possible states.
- If stochastic, the agent will need to consider what to do for each contingency that its percepts may reveal.
    - Percepts reveal which the outcomes has actually occurred.

See 4.3 and 4.4 for more details.

.footnote[Credits: [CS188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/lecture_slides.html), UC Berkeley.]

???

Search problems are models, i.e. abstract mathematical abstractions. These models omit details that not relevant for solving the problem.

The process of removing details from a representation is called abstraction.

- Transition model = The city we arrive in after driving to it.
    - $\text{result}(\text{in}(Arad), \text{go}(Zerind)) = \text{in}(Zerind)$
- Goal test: whether we are in Bucharest.
    - $s \in \\{ \text{in}(\text{Bucharest}) \\}$
- Step cost: distances between cities.

# Selecting a state space

- Real world is absurdly **complex**.
    - The *world state* includes every last detail of the environment.
    - State space must be *abstracted* for problem solving.
- A *search state* keeps only the details needed for planning.
    - Example: eat-all-dots
        - States: $\\{ (x, y), \text{dot booleans}\\}$
        - Actions: NSEW
        - Transition: update location and possibly a dot boolean
        - Goal test: dots all false

# Search trees

The set of possible acceptable sequences starting at the initial state form a **search tree**:
- Nodes correspond to states in the state space, where the initial state is the root node.
- Branches correspond to applicable actions.
    - Child nodes correspond to successors.
- **For most problems, we can never actually build the whole tree**.

# Uninformed search strategies

**Uninformed** search strategies use only the information available in the problem definition.
- They do not know whether a state looks more promising than some other.

Strategies:
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Uniform-cost search
- Iterative deepening

---

# Depth-first search

- *Strategy*: expand the deepest node in the fringe.
- *Implementation*: fringe is a **LIFO stack**.

.width-80.center[![](figures/lec2/dfs-progress.svg)]

---

# Properties of search strategies

- A strategy is defined by picking the **order of expansion**.
- Strategies are evaluated along the following dimensions:
    - *Completeness*: does it always find a solution if one exists?
    - *Optimality*: does it always find the least-cost solution?
    - *Time complexity*: how long does it take to find a solution?
    - *Space complexity*: how much memory is needed to perform the search?
- Time and complexity are measured in terms of
    - $b$: maximum branching factor of the search tree
    - $d$: depth of the least-cost solution
        * the depth of $s$ is defined as the number of actions from the initial state to $s$.
    - $m$: maximum length of any path in the state space (may be $\infty$)

<span class="Q">[Q]</span> Number of nodes in a tree?

???

- Number of nodes = $\frac{b^{d+1}-1}{b-1}$

# Properties of DFS

- *Completeness*:
    - $m$ could be infinite, so only if we prevent cycles (more on this later).
- *Optimality*:
    - No, DFS finds the leftmost solution, regardless of depth or cost.
- *Time complexity*:
    - May generate the whole tree (or a good part of it, regardless of $d$).
      Therefore $O(b^m)$, which might much greater than the size of the state space!
- *Space complexity*:
    - Only store siblings on path to root, therefore $O(bm)$.
    - When all the descendants of a node have been visited, the node can be removed from memory.

- *Strategy*: expand the shallowest node in the fringe.
- *Implementation*: fringe is a **FIFO queue**.

.width-80.center[![](figures/lec2/bfs-progress.svg)]

---

# Properties of BFS

- *Completeness*:
    - If the shallowest goal node is at some finite depth $d$, BFS will eventually find it after generating all shallower nodes (provided $b$ is finite).
- *Optimality*:
    - The shallowest goal is not necessarily the optimal one.
    - BFS is optimal only if the path cost is a non-decreasing function of the depth of the node.
- *Time complexity*:
    - If the solution is a depth $d$, then the total number of nodes generated before finding this node is $b+b^2+b^3+...+b^d = O(b^d)$
- *Space complexity*:
    - The number of nodes to maintain in memory is the size of the fringe, which will be the largest at the last tier. That is $O(b^d)$

# Iterative deepening

- Idea: get DFS's space advantages with BFS's time/shallow solution advantages.

# Properties of UCS

- *Completeness*:
    - Yes, if step cost are all such that $c(s,a,s') \geq \epsilon > 0$.
- *Optimality*:
    - Yes, sinces UCS expands nodes in order of their optimal path cost.
- *Time complexity*:
     - Assume $C^\*$ is the cost of the optimal solution and that step costs are all $\geq \epsilon$.
     - The "effective depth" is then roughly $C^\*/\epsilon$.
     - The worst-case time complexity is $O(b^{C^\*/\epsilon})$.
- *Space complexity*:
     - The number of nodes to maintain is the size of the fringe, so as many as in the last tier $O(b^{C^\*/\epsilon})$.

# Informed search strategies

One of the **issues of UCS** is that it explores the state space in *every direction*,
without exploiting information about the (plausible) location of the goal node.

**Informed** search strategies aim to solve this problem by expanding nodes in

# Heuristics

A **heuristic** (or evaluation) function $h(n)$ is:
- a function that *estimates* the cost of the cheapest path from node $n$ to a goal state;
    - $h(n) \geq 0$ for all nodes $n$
    - $h(n) = 0$ for a goal state.
- is designed for a *particular* search problem.

## Claim

$n$ will be expanded before $B$.

## Proof

Assume $B$ is on the fringe.
Some ancestor $n$ of $A$ is on the fringe too.

- $f(n) \leq f(A)$
    - $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$ (by definition)
    - $f(n) \leq g(A)$ (admissibility of $h$)
    - $f(A) = g(A) + h(A) = g(A)$ ($h=0$ at a goal)
- $f(A) < f(B)$
    - $g(A) < g(B)$ ($B$ is suboptimal)
    - $f(A) < f(B)$ ($h=0$ at a goal)
- $n$ expands before $B$
    - since $f(n) \leq f(A) < f(B)$
]

All ancestors of $A$ expand before $B$, including $A$. Therefore **A* is optimal**.

# Creating admissible heuristics

Most of the work in solving hard search problems optimally is in finding admissible heuristics.

Admissible heuristics can be derived from the exact solutions to *relaxed problems*, where new actions are available.

<br><br>
.center.width-80[![](figures/lec2/admissible-relax.png)]

---

# Dominance

- If $h_1$ and $h_2$ are both admissible and if $h_2(n) \geq h_1(n)$ for all $n$, then $h_2$ **dominates** $h_1$ and is *better* for search.
- Given any admissible heuristics $h_a$ and $h_b$, $$h(n) = \max(h_a(n), h_b(n))$$ is also admissible and dominates $h_a$ and $h_b$.

---

# Learning heuristics from experience

- Assuming an *episodic* environment, an agent can **learn** good heuristics by playing the game many times.
- Each optimal solution $s^\*$ provides *training examples* from which $h(n)$ can be learned.
- Each example consists of a state $n$ from the solution path and the actual cost $g(s^\*)$ of the solution from that point.
- The mapping $n \to g(s^\*)$ can be learned with **supervised learning** algorithms.
    - Linear models, Neural networks, etc.
