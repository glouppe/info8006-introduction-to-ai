## CS188

- Some lessons, exercises, and various other materials are partially adapted from [CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/), from UC Berkeley. 
- Cartoons that you will see in those slides were all originally made for CS188.

- Prepare the exercises proposed the previous week.
- Use this time to get answers to your questions, and not to transcribe everything from the blackboard.
- Solutions are provided for all exercises.

## Honor code

You may consult papers, books, online references, or publicly available implementations for ideas that you may want to adapt and incorporate into your projects, so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup. .bold[However, under no circumstances, may you base your project on someone else's implementation.] One of the main learning outcomes of the programming projects is for you to better understand the course materials.

.bold[Plagiarism is checked and sanctioned by a grade of 0. Cases of plagiarism will all be reported to the Faculty.]
